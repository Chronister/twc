The Tweet text will be rewritten to include the media URL(s), which will reduce the number of characters allowed in the Tweet text. If the URL(s) cannot be appended without text truncation, the tweet will be rejected and this method will return an HTTP 403 error. Users are limited to a specific daily media upload limit. Requests to this endpoint will return the following headers with information regarding the user's current media upload limits: If the user is over the daily media limit, this method will return an HTTP 403 error. In addition to media upload limits, the user is still limited in the number of statuses they can publish daily. If the user tries to exceed the number of updates allowed, this method will also return an HTTP 403 error, similar to POST statuses/update . OAuth is handled differently for POST messages.
